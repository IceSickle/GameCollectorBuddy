GameCollectorBuddy
==================
Java based desktop app using Java 8 So pc only untill mac gets the update. Wanted to create a 
desktop application like CollectorZ but free and able to get live time prices off pricecharting.com
This app uses pricecharting as the database searching the site for games, image, prices as well as giving a link 
right to the game page on the site.

This app will also export data to google spreadsheets for easy sharing and easy lookup via a smartphone.
